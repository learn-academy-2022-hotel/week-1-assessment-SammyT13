# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:  Git is on a user's local machine and a program for version source control.  The difference between git and GitHub is that git is utilized to clone repositories (files), branch, add, commit, and push back to the original repository or branch.  As for GitHub, what makes it different from git, is it is a cloud-based website that stores files and repositories that are cloned or pushed from git.  Both are used to help groups or organizations as version control to protect the main source code.

Researched answer: Git is a version control system that groups and organizations utilize to work on projects more efficiently with a high level of organization.  The primary difference between Git and GitHub is Git is a version control system that helps users manage and track their source code, and GitHub is a cloud-based site that lets users store their repositories and guard their source code.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Boolean operators consist of greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), less than or equal to (<=), strictly equal to (===), loosely equal to (==), not equal to or negation of (!==), which will return if a value or condition is true or false.

Researched answer: Boolean operators consist of greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), less than or equal to (<=), strictly equal to (===), loosely equal to (==), not equal to or negation of (!==), which will return if a value or condition is true or false.  In addition to comparison operators returning boolean values when evaluated, Javascript utilizes and (&&), or (||), and not (! or bang) logical operators for assessing whether a condition is true or false.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is where the value of each character in a string or each element in an array is stored.  The difference between an index and a value is an index of a string or an array is a location where a value is stored, and a value is the actual representation of the value a string or an array may hold, whether it be a number, string, or other data types.

Researched answer: When utilized in Javascript, an index can help a user return value from a string or array depending on the index number provided.  The difference between an index and a value is an index is used to search and return a store value based on the given index number. A value is the actual representation of the data stored in the index, whether a string or an array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings have some differences and similarities between the two.  One way an array and string are similar is a developer can access the value of an array and string by its index.  For example, if we assign 'Hello' to string and ['H,' 'e,' 'l,' 'l,' 'o'] to an array, the value of index three will return a value of 'l' to the user.  This means the value of strings and arrays are stored similarly using indexes.  One way the two are different is typical of the value a string or an array may hold.  Typically a string will hold one word, phrase, or sentence, whereas an array can store several words, phrases, or sentences.  On top of it, an array can also store different data types.  For example, a string variable may be assigned 'Hello World!', an array variable can contain multiple values, like ['Hello World!', 'Welcome to programming!', 100, true, undefined].  Though arrays and strings have many similarities, like specific methods, they also contain plenty of differences.

Researched answer: One significant difference between an array and a string is that an array is a data structure containing any data type. In contrast, a string is considered, and an object that is a data type is only considered a character.  One similarity between an array and a string is how a user can access the value of either by an index.  For example returning the value of index three on a string 'Hello!' or array ['H,' 'e,' 'l,' 'l,' 'o'] will return a value of 'l.'

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques include using source control, to effectively and efficiently pass data between a pair.  Part of the technique consists of open communication and dialogue between the team and fostering a safe place where the individuals can say how they feel.  Part of this open communication involves a driver and a navigator, where the driver types what the navigator communicates to them, whether it be a solution, instructions, or advice.

Researched answer: Pair programming techniques involve a driver and a navigator.  To properly pair programs, the driver is in charge of the keyboard, and the navigator is in order of the instructions.  Typically both developers will take turn driving and navigating.
